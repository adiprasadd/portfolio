          I need to run.

          It is not just a passion; it is a necessity. Running has become an essential part of my routine to counter a hereditary predisposition to Type 2 diabetes. This deeply personal experience not only heightened my awareness of health issues but also fueled my interest in robotics as a potential solution.

          My early exposure to LEGO and robotics kits blossomed into a more profound engagement, culminating in my team placing 2nd at the World Robotics Olympiad Canadian Nationals. This achievement was more than a competition victory; it validated my potential to make a real impact.

        <p className="about-story animate-fade">
          My ambition is to explore multiple facets of medical robotics, from prosthetics to surgical assistants, driven by the desire to innovate in ways that could change lives. I want to use robotics to Re-imagine, Understand and Navigate (R.U.N.) the healthcare field.
        </p>
        <p className="about-story animate-fade">
          Beyond my passion for robotics and health innovation, I am deeply inspired by the endless possibilities of artificial intelligence and its intersection with engineering. Whether tinkering with hardware, writing software, or exploring the interplay between the two, I find joy in creating systems that push boundaries. My interests extend to soccer, where I appreciate the teamwork and strategy that mirror my approach to problem-solving, and music, which fuels my creativity and keeps me grounded. At the core of everything I do is a relentless curiosity and a drive to create meaningful, lasting change.
